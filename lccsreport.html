    <h1> Leaving Cert Coursework project 2025 </h1>
    <h2>Meeting the brief  </h2>


    <h2> Investigate</h2>
    <p>For my investigation process I decided to go with a topic that has interested me from a very long time: The Justice system. Therefore, my coursework project shall centre
        around the amount of court cases that has occurred in the past 2 years, and what these court cases centre around. My hypothesis will be that there are more drug and road cases
        in comparison to murder and crimes of a s_xual offense, as it is more common for cases involving road traffic or drugs to be brought up in court not just in Ireland but internationally
        as well. I believe the justice system is an essential aspect of society as without a proper law system with a clear set of rules then our society and planet would be in immense danger and chaos with
        crimes committed left right and centre. Crime and Justice is an essential part of society today and therefore looking into the amount of crimes that has occurred in the past 2 years
        can indicate the crime rate in Ireland by determining the amount of court cases that have occurred.  For this cpursework project i plan to use my resources from both of my Applied Learning tasks:
        ALT 1 and ALT2. I plan to hopefully implement my interest in justice and law into this project.
    </p>
    <h2> Plan and design </h2>
    <p> When it comes to planning the project, I thought about how to create the algorithm and flowchart for the project and exlain it as best as possible. My website will eb based on the entry requirements such
        as Making it interactive and basing it on my website in order to create an informative system. The goal of this project is so that the user can access the website being
        informed of the various categories that have had court cases and the rates as to where it has been resolved. The website is to inform the user of the various crimes committed
        and the rates as to which those crimes are resolved in court. For my data presentation I plan to use both bar charts adn catter plot as I believe that it is the best way
        to present my data. The website will have the Thus as follows here are the algorithm:  </p>
        <h4> algorithm:</h4>
        <p>1. Enter website  </p> <p>2. Enter homepage</p>  <p>3. Access  </p><p>4. Enter one category </p> <p>5. Arrive at new webpage of said category  </p>
        <p>6.Go back to homepage  </p><p>7. repeat steps 4-6 as many as user desires </p>
